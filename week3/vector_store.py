"""Week 3 — dense retrieval: store chunk embeddings, search them by similarity.

    from vector_store import VectorStore
    store = VectorStore()
    store.add(chunks)                      # embeds and stores every chunk, once
    results = store.search("a question")   # embeds the question, searches the index

This is the "ingest once, query every call" half of the retrieval pipeline from
week-03-lecture-plan.md §6: `add()` is the ingestion-time work, `search()` is what
runs on every question.

The store is PERSISTENT, and that matters more than it looks
--------------------------------------------------------------
Embeddings are written to `./chroma/` on disk and survive the process. Embed a
corpus once, with `python ingest.py`, and every notebook and script afterwards
opens the same index without paying for it again.

This is not a performance nicety. `gemini-embedding-001` allows roughly 100 texts
per minute (measured 2026-09-14), so a 3,000-chunk corpus is about half an hour of
ingest. An in-memory store would spend that again on every kernel restart.

`reset=True` clears the collection first -- which is what you want after changing
chunk size, and never want otherwise.

Chroma's default distance is NOT cosine
-----------------------------------------
Confirmed 2026-09-13: an unconfigured Chroma collection uses squared Euclidean
distance. This course teaches and measures cosine similarity, so the collection
below is created with `metadata={"hnsw:space": "cosine"}` explicitly. Without that
line, `search()`'s scores would not be the metric taught in the lecture, silently.
